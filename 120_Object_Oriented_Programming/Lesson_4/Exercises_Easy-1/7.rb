# What is the default thing that Ruby will print
# to the screen if you call to_s on an object?
# Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

# ANSWER:
# The default thing Ruby prints with using to_s,
# is the object name and where it's stored in memory.
# to be sure one could reference the Ruby documentation on the
# Object class for the to_s method.
