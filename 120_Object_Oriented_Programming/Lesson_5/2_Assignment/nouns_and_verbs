Preparing to Code Tic Tac Toe:

We'll take an object-oriented approach to designing the solution, so we'll employ the steps we learned earlier:

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.

Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player board game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square. The first player to mark 3 squares in a row wins.

Nouns: board, player, square, grid
Verbs: play, mark

2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs into nouns and do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.

Board
Square
Player
- mark
- play

3. Optional - when you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
