Preparing to Code Memory Game:

We'll take an object-oriented approach to designing the solution, so we'll employ the steps we learned earlier:

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.

Memory is a board game where players play on a grid. Each player takes turns selecting 2 face down cards which get flipped over and they are trying to get a match.

Nouns: board, player, grid
Verbs: play, select, match, flip

2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs into nouns and do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.

Board
Square
Player
- flip
- play
- match

3. Optional - when you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
